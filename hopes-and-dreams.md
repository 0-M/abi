where unicorns roam and stray ideas appear

## What I hope this will become

- a cross-platform open-source AI assistant
- greater than the sum of its parts
- a *free* replacement for Siri or Google Assistant




## Example phrases that should be handled

**Phase 1: basics**
- "what time is it?"
- "tell me a joke"


**Phase 2: basic integrations**
- "search **X** on google"
- "tweet this: **X**"
- "play **X** with VLC"


## BRAINSTORM:

photo recognition?
